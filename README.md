 Confusion-Emotion-Recognition from EEG Signals
Recognizing learners' confusion is essential for educators as it greatly impacts learning. While confusion can initially motivate students, prolonged confusion can hinder the learning process.

Educators typically identify confusion based on their own understanding, but advances in Affective Computing have led to the development of computerized systems that use psychophysiological signals (e.g., EEG) and Machine Learning (ML) models to recognize learner emotions.

However, current research lacks sufficient focus on designing confusion emotion recognition systems suitable for real-world learning environments
In this research, two major identified research gaps were identified and addressed. They were:  
a) Reduced model performance in existing confusion emotion models due to Bias â€“ Variance Dilemma

b)Limited R&D on cost-sensitive model which may lead to cost inefficiency in existing confusion emotion models

Addressing the research gaps aided in developing confusion emotion model that is both performance and cost efficient.
